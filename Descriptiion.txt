Smart Electronic Voting Machine Using Arduino

This project aims to design a simple and smart electronic voting machine using Arduino. The goal is to create a more secure and efficient voting system that eliminates the possibility of fraud associated with manual voting and earlier versions of electronic voting machines.

In this system, each political party is represented by a switch (one for each party). Voters can select their preferred candidate by pressing the corresponding button. The vote count is displayed on an LCD screen, providing immediate feedback to the voter, ensuring transparency and accuracy.

Once voting is completed, the result can be calculated and displayed by pressing a "Result" button. This final step will show the party with the highest number of votes, ensuring a fair and clear election process. The use of Arduino makes this system cost-effective and easy to implement, offering a smart solution for modern voting needs.
