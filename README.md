**Smart Electronic Voting Machine Using Arduino**

This project demonstrates a simple and smart electronic voting machine using an Arduino. 
The goal is to create an automated, transparent, and efficient voting system that eliminates the possibility of manual errors or fraud in traditional voting systems.
Project Overview

The system allows voters to cast their votes for different candidates using push buttons. 
The results are displayed on an LCD screen, and the winner is determined by the highest number of votes. The system resets after displaying the result, ready for the next round of voting.
Features:

    4 candidates (A, B, C, D) to vote for.
    Real-time vote counting displayed on an LCD screen.
    Option to view the result after all votes are cast.
    The system automatically resets after displaying the result.

Components Used:

    Arduino Uno (or any compatible Arduino board)
    16x2 LCD Display (LiquidCrystal)
    5 Push Buttons (S1 to S4 for voting, S5 for viewing the result)
    Jumper Wires
    Breadboard

Circuit Diagram:

    Push Buttons (S1 to S4): These buttons correspond to candidates A, B, C, and D. Each button is connected to a digital pin of the Arduino (pins 3, 4, 5, 6).
    Push Button (S5): This button is used to display the result. It is connected to pin 7.
    LCD: The LCD is connected to the Arduino using the standard 16x2 pinout (pins 8 to 13).

Code Description:

The Arduino code handles the following tasks:

    Initialize the LCD and display a welcome message.
    Wait for the voter to press one of the buttons (S1 to S4) to vote for a candidate.
    Increment the vote count for the selected candidate and update the LCD.
    When the result button (S5) is pressed, calculate the winner based on the highest vote count and display it on the LCD.
    Reset the vote counts for the next round of voting.

How to Use:

    Connect the hardware:
        Connect the LCD to the Arduino as per the pin configuration in the code.
        Connect the push buttons (S1 to S5) to the specified pins on the Arduino.

    Upload the code:
        Open the Arduino IDE, copy the code into the editor, and upload it to the Arduino board.

    Voting Process:
        The LCD will display the message "Electronic Voting Machine" followed by the candidate options (A, B, C, D).
        Press one of the buttons (S1, S2, S3, or S4) to cast your vote for the corresponding candidate.
        After voting, press the Result Button (S5) to display the winner.
        The system will reset the vote counts and prepare for the next round.
